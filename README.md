# SMP_Lab_1
Repository for the 1st lab of discipline 'Scripting programming languages' ('Скриптові мови програмування' - SMP)
This repository consists of 6 files:
- app.js (testing work of main program);
- app.test.js (testing for Jest and SuperTest components);
- server.js (initialising of a server for app.test.js);
- start.js (starting a server);
- package.json (additional information to project, which is generated semi-automatically);
- Dotenv.txt (for usage of Dotenv).
ATTENTION: Dotenv.txt is an exchange file for .env. Last one can`t be uploaded due to GitHub`s comlpains about 'hidden file'. So, in original project you need to use .env, not a Dotenv.txt.
